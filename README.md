# Intro

This fullstack vue and express project was created after following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-b9KGwVECs) tutorial and is saved on github just for archival purposes, to be a reference for me in the future.

## client folder

classic vue app and access data from server via api

## server folder

express app that exposes api and connects to local mongodb database

## configuration

both parts contain some documentation for production environment
